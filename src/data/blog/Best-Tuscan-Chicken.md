I made this creamy Tuscan chicken—super tasty and hearty!

I mostly followed [this guide](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a19636089/creamy-tuscan-chicken-recipe/).

It turned out well-balanced and full of flavor.

The only change I made: I used Herbes de Provence (fancy, right?) instead of oregano.

Highly recommend. The sauce is incredible—I served it with rice.
