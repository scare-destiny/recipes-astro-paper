This is what I made. Super tasty and hearty!

Honestly, I've mostly followed [this](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a19636089/creamy-tuscan-chicken-recipe/) guide.

It turned out to be a well-rounded recipe.

The only thing I made differently is I used Herbes de Provence (what a fancy name) instead of oregano.
