Hej you, welcome!

I love cooking. Really. It means a lot to me. The smells, creativity, making food for someone else.

And even more, it's personal for me. My mother passed away, and when she died I felt like when I cook, I'm with her again.

I also like writing. And my life principle is to share everything I learn. Now I learn and cook a lot, so why not combine both?

So I plan to share! I like spicy food (I want to learn more about Indian cuisine), nutritious foods, and veggies.

Join me for the ride. It should be fun and smell like your cherished memories!
