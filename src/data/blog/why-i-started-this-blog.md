Hej you, welcome!

![something](@/assets/images/Eugene_Venger.jpg)

I love cooking. Really. It means a lot to me. Smells, creativity, making food for someone else.

And even more, it's personal for me. My mother passed away, and when she died I feel like when I cook I'm with her again.

And also I like writing. And my life principle is to share everything I learn. Now I learn and cook a lot. 
So why not combine both?

Sooo I plan to share. I like spicy (wanna learn more of Indian cuisine), nutritious foods, veggies.
